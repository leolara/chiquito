# Chiquito

# Project Description

Chiquito is a step-based high-level rust DSL (pychiquito is a python DSL for chiquito) that provides better syntax and abstraction for constraint building and column placement when writing plonkish circuits and has a Halo2 backend, and other backends are in the works. It allows the user to manipulate an AST thatâ€™s compiled to a Chiquito Halo2 backend, which can be integrated into any Halo2 circuit.

It's **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** that you read the [design principles](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#design-principles), [architecture, and specific terms](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#architecture) of a Chiquito circuit before getting started.

You can also learn about the project's [current status](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#project-status-as-of-april-2023) and its [next steps](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#vision-and-next-steps).

# Getting Started

## Setup

Run the following in command line to add Chiquito as a dependency for your project:

```
cargo add --git https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito
```

Use the following examples to understand how Chiquito works or use them as starting templates for building your own Chiquito circuit.

Refer to the Appendix on the [exposed user functions](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#exposed-user-functions) and [overall workflow](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/blob/main/Appendix.md/#overall-workflow) of a Chiquito circuit.

Refer to [Testing and Links](#testing-and-links) on detailed API documentations.

## Example: Fibonacci Circuit

Run the following in command line:

```
cargo run --example fibonacci
```

This example demonstrates how to construct signals, step types, constraints, and witness generation in Chiquito. Best for first time Chiquito users.

## Example: MiMC7 Circuit

TODO: annotate this code example

This example demonstrates how to construct a lookup table and use external inputs as trace arguments in Chiquito, besides covering concepts in the Fibonacci example. MiMC7 is a zk-friendly hashing function.

## Example: zkEVM Bytecode Circuit

https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zkevm-circuits/pull/1348

This example rewrites the zkEVM bytecode circuit using Chiquito and passes all original tests. It demonstrates how Chiquito can standardize and simplify larger scale circuits on the production level.

## Python bindings

There are 2 ways to install chiquito python bindings

### Install chiquito with pip

To use chiquito in Python, just need to install it with pip

```bash
pip install chiquito
```

### Build from source

Chiquito is built in Rust. First [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), then clone this repo and enter the repo directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito
cd chiquito
```

Then build the python bindings with maturin

```bash
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install maturin
maturin develop
```
